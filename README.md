# Taskboard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tarlepp/Taskboard.png?branch=0.10)](https://travis-ci.org/tarlepp/Taskboard)
### a Sails application to mimic "scrum-ban" taskboard.

Note this is a heavy devel branch, most likely nothing works... yet

Main goal in this branch is:
 - Sails.js 0.10.x branch
 - Knockout => Angular.js
 - Require.js
 - SCSS / SASS support
 - This list will be updated...

Not much, just a little bit of work :D
