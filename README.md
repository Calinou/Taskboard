# Taskboard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tarlepp/Taskboard.png?branch=angular)](https://travis-ci.org/tarlepp/Taskboard)
### a Sails application to mimic "scrum-ban" taskboard.

Note this is a heavy development branch, most likely nothing works... yet

Main goal in this branch is:
 - Sails.js 0.10.x branch
 - Knockout => Angular.js
 - SCSS / SASS support
 - Separate back- and frontend

Not much, just a little bit of work :D

**Note** Do not use this in production, basically this is just a prototype nothing else at this moment...

### Directory structure
```
backend/    = Sails.js server, just API nothing else
frontend/   = Slush-angular, just frontend side
```

#### Backend
For backend Taskboard uses Sails.js framework. See more info at https://github.com/balderdashy/sails

#### Frontend
Taskboard uses slush-angular for frontend (AngularJS using Google Angular App Structure Recommendations).
See more info at https://github.com/slushjs/slush-angular This library is awesome to distribute frontend.
